# Pharmacy-Management-App

This project focuses on overseeing the operations of a pharmacy named LAMBDA. 

Similar to other businesses, pharmacies are required to uphold their inventory as they market products. 
They play a vital role in our healthcare system by supplying medications and offering health advice to patients. 
However, efficient pharmacy management poses challenges, encompassing inventory, sales, supplier and customer relations, and compliance with health regulations. 

In this study, we will investigate various management strategies that can be applied to improve a pharmacy's effectiveness and profitability.

This application aims to streamline processes, reducing time and resource consumption by systematically maintaining drug details. 
This organized data can be quickly utilized when needed, minimizing the usage of workforce, finances, and paperwork. 

By doing so, it alleviates the workload on pharmacists and cashiers, enhancing the system's efficiency and providing more accurate information about medical drugs.
